<h1>Checking an e-mail security</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
Within this project, I checked the security level of a personal e-mail account that I'm not using it for daily basis, where I approached the three principles of the CIA triad (Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability).<br />

<h2>Languages and Utilities Used</h2>

- <b>[Password Strength Meter](https://www.passwordmonster.com/)</b> 
- <b>[Yahoo Web services](https://www.yahoo.com/) </b>

<h2>Environments Used </h2>

- <b>Windows 11</b> (10.0.26100)
